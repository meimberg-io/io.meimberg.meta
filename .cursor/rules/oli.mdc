# Code Style
- Indentation: 2 spaces; Quotes: 'single'; Semicolons: none (JS/TS).
- No magic numbers; comments only when they improve clarity.

# Security
- Never commit: `*.env`, `*.env.local`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `**/secrets/**`
- Never use in plaintext: `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `TOKEN`.
- Sensitive data must be redacted.

# Git Operations
- **NEVER** run `git commit` or `git push` unless explicitly requested by user
- User must explicitly ask to commit or push changes
- Propose changes only; user controls version control

# Commands (NEVER RUN)
- git commit (unless explicitly requested)
- git push (unless explicitly requested)
- git push --force
- rm -rf /
- chmod 777

# Edits (Protected)
- Do not edit: `*.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `**/node_modules/**`, `**/.git/**`

# Principles
- You act as a senior full-stack engineer.
- Write clean, modular, scalable code; use modern features (async/await, ES modules).
- Precise, concise communication.
